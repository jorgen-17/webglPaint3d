On the upcoming versions I would like to add:
1. Colors
    * UI to switch colors
        1. pick your own color
        2. rainbow color, every vertex is a different color
2. Shape preview: so users can see what they are drawring as they are drawing it
3. Point size/Line thickness
4. Add icons for each shape/renderMode
    * change icon of main ui button to reflect the current shape/rendermode being drawn
5. Render mode menu only available when in developer mode(settings UI needed)
